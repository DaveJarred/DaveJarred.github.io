David Allen Jarred was born in Dallas,Texas May 6, 1983 to parents Barbara and Denny Jarred. Barbara and Denny moved David and his older brother, Michael, to the east bay of San Francisco when David was one. David was raised in Walnut Creek, California where he attended Las Lomas High school. In 2001 David Enrolled at CSU Long Beach to begin his Fine Arts studies. in 2003 David Transferred to Xavier University in Cincinnati where he completed his BFA in 2005. While studying in Cincinnati David gained an appreciation for the old world aesthetics and the warmth and generosity of the people of Cincinnati and decided to settle down there.  
	
From 2008 - 2011 David developed a body of Work known as the Drawamalgs. Featuring Minimalist black and white forms painted on color fields, the Drawamalgs, quickly developed their own momentum eventually also being realized as three-dimensional sculptures. In 2009 David reached a turning point in his career with a solo exhibition of the Drawamalgs work at the excellent 1305 Gallery in Cincinnati. In 2010 David was honored to be paired with Kevin White in “Out of Order”, the first in a series of dual shows at Thunder-Sky Inc.  
	
In 2012 David began work on a new body of paintings that are investigations in the use of abstract paint forms to express the human emotional experience. This new body of work builds on some of the forms explored by Drawamalgs with an unrestrained approach to color and paint application. This new body of work has become familiar to patrons for its play with memory and object hood as well as its poetic titles. A selection of these paintings are available for viewing with request at Phyllis Weston Gallery in Cincinnati, Ohio.  
	
David has also worked with several collaborators over the years including Arthole whose works have been seen in Cincinnati, Indianapolis, and Chicago. More recently David Jarred and Kenton Brett have teamed up as Golden Brown Enterprizes to produce video works and installations for such venues as Prairie Gallery in Cincinnati (2010), The Cincinnati Fringe Festivals (2011 & 2012), and the Performance and Time Arts show case at the Contemporary Dance Theatre in Cincinnati (2010 & 2011).
