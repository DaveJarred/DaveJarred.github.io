​The current body of paintings I am producing are created as representations of my own visceral reactions. I start out with an automatic drawing method to create a very raw and emotional gesture. As the gesture develops its own structure and dimensionality I begin to respond intuitively applying planes of color. The planes of color work together to create invented dimensional forms that seem to represent familiar objects. As the colors become more and more complex with glazes and texturing the forms become tactile and rich in emotional nuance. The process of these paintings are important because through the intuitive response to visceral reactions I am able to access parts of my unconscious mind while remaining conscious of my painting methods. I believe the more access I gain to to this rich unconscious aesthetic the more I am able to express my personal human experience in an honest abstract way.  

​The Influences for my work are many and varied in disciplines. Some of the most fruitful inspirations I find are from musicians. For some reason music seem to have a much more direct conduit to the unconscious parts of the brain than most other art forms and can therefore create a visceral reaction with much greater efficiency. One of my aims with this work is to create an abstract language of expression that can tap into these visceral reactions the way an excellent performance of Schumann or Beethoven might. There are also some visual artists I have grown to appreciate for this ability such as Philip Guston, Eva Hesse, and Eugen Schönebeck. I also appreciate the ability of an artist to create a multi-faceted emotion like Shakespeare who is able to make his characters writhe with anger while lamenting a loss, or laugh at their own despicable situation. It is my aim to use paint to tackle these themes of irony and fluctuating emotion like these great masters have done in their respective crafts.
